The MarkLogic Node.js Client API provides access to the MarkLogic database
from Node.js applications.

* Querying over documents including parsing string queries, extracting properties, and calculating facets
* Projecting tuples (like table rows) out of documents
* Single transactions and multi-statement transactions for database changes
* Writing, reading, and deleting graphs and executing SPARQL queries over graphs
* Extending the built-in services or evaluating or invoking your own JavaScript or XQuery on the server
* Basic, digest, certificate, Kerberos, and SAML authentication
* Import libraries as JavaScript mjs modules
* Data Services First - MarkLogic's support for microservices
* Optic query DSL, document matching, relevance, multiple groups
* Generate query based views, redaction on rows
* Data Movement SDK - move large amounts of data into, out of, or within a MarkLogic cluster

## Getting Started

You can install the marklogic package as a dependency for your Node.js project
using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marklogic):

```
npm install marklogic --save
```

For Windows OS please use the below for Node Client 2.9.1:
```
npm install marklogic --save --ignore-scripts
```

With the marklogic package installed, the following inserts two documents in a
collection into the Documents database using MarkLogic's built-in REST server
at port 8000:

```javascript
var marklogic = require('marklogic');

var db = marklogic.createDatabaseClient({
  host:     'localhost',
  port:     '8000',
  database: 'Documents',
  user:     'admin',
  password: 'admin',
  authType: 'DIGEST'
});

db.createCollection(
  '/books',
  {author: 'Beryl Markham', ...},
  {author: 'WG Sebald',     ...}
  )
.result(function(response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
  }, function (error) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
  });
```

### Code Examples

The Node.js Client API ships with code examples to supplement the examples
in the online resources. To run the examples, follow the instructions here:

### Generating Documentation Locally

After installing the project dependencies (including the [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
build system), you can build the reference documentation locally from the root
directory of the marklogic package:

    npm run doc

The documentation is generated in a doc subdirectory. The documentation can also be
accessed online [here](https://docs.marklogic.com/jsdoc/index.html).

### Running Tests

To set up the database and REST server for tests, execute the following
command from the root directory for the marklogic package:

    npm run test:setup

After setup, you can run tests for the Node.js Client API with the following
command:

    npm test

To tear down the test database and REST server, execute the following:

    npm run test:teardown
