# MarkLogic Client API for Node.js

The MarkLogic Client API for Node.js provides access to the MarkLogic database
from Node.js applications.

## Features

*  Writing, reading, patching, and deleting documents in JSON, XML, text, or binary formats
*  Querying over documents including parsing string queries, extracting properties, and calculating facets
*  Projecting tuples (like table rows) out of documents
*  Single transactions and multi-statement transactions for database changes
*  Writing, reading, and deleting graphs and executing SPARQL queries over graphs
*  Extending the built-in services or evaluating or invoking your own JavaScript or XQuery on the server
*  Basic, digest, certificate, and [Kerberos](KERBEROS.md) authentication

## Status

Release 2.0.0 Early Access 4 of the MarkLogic Node.js API

For more information about these features, see the [Early Access site](https://ea.marklogic.com/features/additional-enhancements/node-js/).

## Sample

First, install the MarkLogic into your local modules using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marklogic).

```
npm install marklogic --save
```

The following example creates two documents in a collection using the built-in
REST server for the Documents database:

```javascript
var marklogic = require('marklogic');

var db = marklogic.createDatabaseClient({
  host:     'localhost',
  port:     '8000',
  user:     'admin',
  password: 'admin',
  authType: 'DIGEST'
});

db.createCollection(
  '/books',
  {author: 'Beryl Markham', ...},
  {author: 'WG Sebald',     ...}
  )
.result(function(response) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response,null,2));
  }, function (error) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(error,null,2));
  });
```

Other calls can create additional documents for the same collection.

## Getting started

Here are some resources that walk you through working with MarkLogic using the Node.js API:

* http://developer.marklogic.com/features/node-client-api
* http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/node-dev/intro#id_68052

The instructions describe:

* installing the MarkLogic database and setting up an admin user
* installing the Node.js API using npm
* working through some initial examples to get familiar with the API

### Example setup

The Node.js API also distributes with some additional examples to supplement
the examples from the Getting Started introduction.

Follow the instructions in the example distribution:

    examples/1readme.txt

### Documentation setup

After installing the dependencies including gulp, you can also build the reference
documentation locally from the root directory of the marklogic package:

    gulp doc

The documentation should be produced in the doc subdirectory.

### Test setup and teardown

To set up the test database and REST server, execute the following
command in the root directory for the marklogic package:

    node etc/test-setup.js

To tear down the test database and REST server, execute

    node etc/test-teardown.js
