Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's high population density and limited natural resources result in poor economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment in neighboring countries.","geo":{"Location":"Western Africa, north of Ghana","Geographic coordinates":{"N":{"deg":13,"min":0},"W":{"deg":2,"min":0}},"Map references":{},"Area":{"total":{"quantity":274200,"unit":"sq km"},"country comparison to the world":"","land":{"quantity":273800,"unit":"sq km"},"water":{"quantity":400,"unit":"sq km"}},"Area - comparative":"slightly larger than Colorado","Land boundaries":{"total":{"quantity":3193,"unit":"km"},"border countries":"Benin 306 km, Cote d'Ivoire 584 km, Ghana 549 km, Mali 1,000 km, Niger 628 km, Togo 126 km"},"Coastline":{"quantity":0,"unit":"km"},"Maritime claims":"none (landlocked)","Terrain":"mostly flat to dissected, undulating plains;

The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has embarked upon a gradual privatization of state-owned enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to attract foreign investment. As a result of this new code and other legislation favoring the mining sector, the country has seen an upswing in gold exploration and production. By 2010, gold had become the main source of export revenue.","GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"GDP (purchasing power parity)":{"usd":19990000000},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP (official exchange rate)":{"usd":8781000000},"GDP - real growth rate":{"quantity":5.8,"unit":"%"},"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"GDP - per capita (PPP)":{"usd":null},"country comparison to the world":""},"GDP - composition by sector":{"agriculture":{"quantity":30.1,"unit":"%"},"industry":{"quantity":20.7,"unit":"%"},"services":{"quantity":49.2,"unit":"%"}},"Labor force":{"Labor force":6668000,"country comparison to the world":""},"Labor force - by occupation":{"agriculture":{"quantity":90,"unit":"%"},"industry and services":{"quantity":10,"unit":"%"}},"Unemployment rate":{"quantity":77,"unit":"%"},"Population below poverty line":{"quantity":46.4,"unit":"%"},"Household income or consumption by percentage share":{"lowest 10%":{"quantity":2.8,"unit":"%"},"highest 10%":{"quantity":32.2,"unit":"%"}},"Distribution of family income - Gini index":39.5,"Investment (gross fixed)":{"quantity":19.7,"unit":"% of GDP"},"Budget":{"revenues":{"usd":1870000000},"expenditures":{"usd":2343000000}},"Inflation rate (consumer prices)":{"quantity":1.4,"unit":"%"},"Central bank discount rate":{"quantity":4.25,"unit":"%"},"Commercial bank prime lending rate":"NA%","Stock of narrow money":{"usd":1416000000},"Stock of broad money":{"usd":2406000000},"Stock of domestic credit":{"usd":1373000000},"Market value of publicly traded shares":"$NA","Industrial production growth rate":{"quantity":5.5,"unit":"%"},"Electricity - production":{"quantity":611600000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - consumption":{"quantity":568800000,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Electricity - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"kWh"},"Oil - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - consumption":{"quantity":9000,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - imports":{"quantity":8283,"unit":"bbl/day"},"Oil - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"bbl"},"Natural gas - production":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - consumption":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - exports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - imports":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Natural gas - proved reserves":{"quantity":0,"unit":"cu m"},"Current account balance":"$-486 million (2010 est.)","Exports":{"usd":991000000},"Imports":{"usd":1480000000},"Reserves of foreign exchange and gold":{"usd":1588000000},"Debt - external":{"usd":2001999999.9999998},"Exchange rates":"Communaute Financiere Africaine francs (XOF) per US dollar -","industries":["cotton lint, beverages, agricultural processing, soap, cigarettes, textiles, gold"],"agricultureProducts":["cotton","peanuts","shea nuts","sesame","sorghum","millet","corn","rice","livestock"],"exportCommodities":["cotton","livestock","gold"],"exportPartners":["Singapore 16.76%","Belgium 12.78%","China 7.59%","Ghana 6.89%","India 6.36%","Denmark 5.76%","Niger 5.13%","Thailand 4.52%"],"importCommodities":["capital goods","foodstuffs","petroleum"],"importPartners":["Cote d'Ivoire 24.31%","France 19.48%","Togo 6.42%"]},"communications":{"Telephones - main lines in use":167000,"Telephones - mobile cellular":3299000,"Telephone system":{"general assessment":"system includes microwave radio relay, open-wire, and radiotelephone communication stations;
